# HealthBook

HealthBook is a web application that allows users to easily organize and manage their healthcare data. From medical provider information to appointment details, Healthbook allows patients to store important personal health data in one secure place.

## Why?

Traditionally, your medical history has been scattered across different clinics, hospitals, and healthcare facilities. Through my experience in healthcare, I observed that many patients have trouble organizing essential information, such as clinic phone numbers, medicine prescribers, and post-appointment notes. HealthBook allows users to easily organize and store all their healthcare data in one secure place.

## Features:

- Easily add your doctors, specialists, and healthcare providers into your "Professionals" page to store important contact information.
- Track your medication functions and frequencies to never miss a dose.
- Select your "Professionals" as a medicine prescriber.
- Schedule, track, a review your previous and upcoming medical appointments.
- Create pre-appointment notes to be prepared for appointments.
- Create post-appointment notes to track your medical history.
- Link one of your "Professionals" to your appointment.
