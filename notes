All three above task are finished and work in postman. Also wrote the add doctors validations, and those work as well. Started the add doctors modal pop-up
Next:
  - finish add doctors modals and make sure it works properly with the apis. start at ../components/addDoctor. Partially finished on Dec 18th, the form works to post information into the database. Still can make better specific input attributes for phone number
  - display all the doctors and appropriate information in a nice way using the GET request
  - add an edit modal with a delete button that works properly with the apis

Date: Dec 19, 2023
2/3 task above were finished. Doctors are now displayed properly. Edit modals for each doctor are mapped as well.Editting function works.
Next:
  - when I hit cancel of the edit modal, the form should not save. continue with /client/comopents/editDoctor
  - when I update the doctor information the order of the Doctor's listed should not change. maybe I need to sort by the doctor_id, before I map it out
  - make a delete button inside the edit modal

Date: Dec 20, 2023
Completed 3/3 of the tasks above. Displayed doctors are always sorted according to doctor_id, delete button implemented with a confirmation modal. Cancelling in the modal with return all inputs to their default states. Additionally, figured out how to add, delete, and edit doctors while updating the modal without refreshing the page (better user experience).
Next:
  - maybe need to make sure that when people open up modals, they are openning up their own?
  - need to make sure that if there are no notes, I don't display the category
  - start working on the medicine page

Date: Dec 23, 2023
Complete 3/3 tasks above. When people are opeeing up modals, it is run locally on their computer. if the notes is empty, the notes: jsx will not render. Started working on the medicine page
Next:
  - work on the logic of the validators middleware for medicine
  - find out a way to only perform a check on the doctor_id and other prescribers if the prescription is true. start at /server/src/validators/auth
  - finish the post route for /medicine

Date: Dec 30, 2023
Worked on the validators middleware logic. Tried to make a custom checker, however the problem is that when a field is checked, they will automatically throw an error if it is empty. I need some medicines that are not prescribed to have empty doctor_id and other_prescriber. If the prescribed is ticked false, the validation should pass with those 2 fields being empty.
Next:
  - try to see if a foreign key in a table must be filled out, or if it's okay if it's empty upon posting a row of information
  - start on server/src/validators/auth

Date: Dec 31, 2023
Was able to solve the problem by having a middleware function that returns the result of the check if the prescription value is true and the doctorId is empty. PUT and DELETE request for medicine also work on postman!
Next:
  - set-up react front-end for the medicine page

Date: Jan 2, 2024
Front-end if almost finished setting up, solved all the conditional rendering for the add medicine page. Showing all the medicines correctly. Deleting medicines also works.
Next:
  - make sure that after a doctor is selected in the drop down menu of the add medicine component, once the no prescription is pressed, the doctorId value is reset back to null.
  - fix server-side add medicine validations, don't need to have to check for "other" in doctorId anymore
  - bug test the add medicine component
  - make sure that instead of getting the doctor_id on the medicine page, I want to get the doctor firstname that is associated with that doctor_id
  - work on the edit button for medicine

Date: Jan 3, 2024
5/5 task above finsished. Learned how to use join in sql to fetch data from 2 related tables to display doctor info alongside the medicine. Started working on the edit button. It looks almost right however there are a few things to fix
Next:
  - the edit modal should have the doctor or other auto selected in the drop down menu if it was originally selected
  - test that the modal is editting the information correctly even if prescription and other and doctorId changes
  - start planning and working on appointments page

Date: Jan 6, 2024
2/3 tasks finished. However, there is a problem if you change the prescriber in the drop down menu and then close the modal and don't refresh, when the click back into the modal, the changed prescriber is actually in the modal even tho there hasn't been a change, maybe i need to refresh the modal evertime I click into it?
Next:
  - fix above problem with edit modal
  - start planning and working on appointments page

Date Jan 7, 2024
2/2 tasks finished. Made sure that after selecting another prescriber and then closing the modal will not save the changes once the modal is openning up again. This this by setting a value prop for the select element. This allows the default value to be selected evertime a modal is openned up. Edit modal is now working like a charm. Also started working on the routes for the appointments. The get route is working on postman. I need to decide if i've set up the appointments database in a way I like.
Next:
  - research and consider getting rid of the time column and just having date? maybe this will be easier?
  - finish the post, put, and delete route for the appointment apis 
  - start working on the front end appointment page

Date Jan 8, 2024
2/3 tasks finished. Decided to keep a date and time column section for the appointments table, allows the front end booking system to be more flexible. Finished the post, put, and delete routes for the appointment apis.
Next:
  - start working on the appointments page front-end

Date Jan 9, 2024
1/1 tasks started. I have the get and post api's figured out for the front-end. Cannot seem to figure out how to reset the placeholder of the select element after choosing 'other' and then closing the modal. Finally fixed bug, all I needed was a seperate state that controlled whether the select was true or false. html is amazing and allowed me to do the date picker really easily

Date Jan 15, 2024
Finished 2/2 task. Dates are formatted properly based on if they match with the current year. Additionally, the appointments will be sorted by the time if the date is the same.
